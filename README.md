# TokenSwap

In this exercise you're going to implement a very simple AMM for fictional stablecoins.  The TokenSwap contract creates a trading pair between two equally valued stablecoins.  Users can supply stablecoins as liquidity and earn transaction fees, and users can swap stablecoins and pay transaction fees.

An interface has been provided called TokenSwapInterface.  You must create a TokenSwap contract that implements this interface.

# Setup

Clone this repository and setup the right version of node:

```sh
$ nvm use
```

Now install dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn
```

You're ready.

# Implement Contract

The test has already been written for you in `test/TokenSwap.test.js`.  Complete the implementation such that the tests pass.
